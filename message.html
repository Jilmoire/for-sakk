            Hello Sakk! It's a bit late but congratulations on graduating SHS! I'm really proud of you and your quiet wins.
            Your endurance agaisnt anything distressing is really admirable. I'm glad you made it to the end of SHS without losing hope!
            I want to say thank you for being a great inspiration to me as well as to other people around us. I really appreciate it.

            During the first semester of the whole school year, I was thinking about how to connect again with you. 
            I don't want to keep the awkward phase going anymore (although you already know this).
            The more days that pass by, the more bothersome the feeling became. I'm not the type to initiate but I just did what I wanted to do:
            I liked some of your IG stories, heart reacted some notes, and felt something I ususally wont do for someone I'm not even close with - worrying and checking in (worried friend type shii).
            Well, I guess it somehow worked. We started talking and bickering, there were times I would sit close to you and you finally didn't move away.
            I was happy with that progress but there's this sense of deficiency or whatever that was. The important thing is that the awkward phase ended.

            If you think about it, it's kind of funny. You have this guy who you barely knew suddenly wanting a close relationship.
            "Wow, is this even me?" I thought at first. "F*ck it, I'm just sending it." then suddenly you have someone asking for your credit card pin number.
            "Oh, is that so? I didn't know you liked this." brother I DIDN'T KNOW I COULD TALK TO SOMEONE LIKE THIS?!? HELLO?!?!? HELP?????
            "How's your day?", "Were you busy?" Obviously you are, but I'd love to hear how things have been on your end.
            "Are you okay?", "How are you feeling?" Maybe yes, sometimes a no. But I'm open to listen in to anything that occupies your mind.

            You know I'm the hypervigilant type of person and you might notice it by the different ways I try to treat you.
            You're this person that I want to be safe and sound as long as we're together and so I try to see and hear your needs, directly or not I have my ways.
            I want to know more about you that's why we're taking it slow and steady, but if both of us are ready then I'd like to take another step closer to you.
            That's why in every lifetime, I'll choose you and  even if the time rewinds itself I will still find my way to you.
            So, Can I be yours? and that is my question for you.

            It's been a little more than a month since I started expressing my feelings for you. 
            To be honest, I had this idea that you will take my actions as just friendly gestures and even distance again from me, it's a sad thought I know.
            I was surpised that you just went with it, but I'm very grateful that you stayed.
            I wish you all the best for your future endeavors and please know that I'm always here through your hardships and success.
            I'm really lucky to have each other and I hope you feel the same. Again, congratulations.
